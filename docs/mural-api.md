### Widget Properties

Common properties across most widget types:

- **Position**: `x`, `y` coordinates on the mural canvas
- **Size**: `width`, `height` dimensions (where applicable)
- **Style**: Visual styling properties (colors, fonts, etc.)
- **Content**: Text content or references to external resources

### Content Limits

- **Sticky Notes**: Maximum 1000 per request
- **Text Content**: Character limits vary by widget type
- **File Uploads**: Size limits apply (refer to API documentation)

## API Scopes

The following OAuth scopes are available:

- `workspaces:read` - Read workspace information
- `rooms:read` - Read room information
- `rooms:write` - Create, update, and delete rooms
- `murals:read` - Read mural information
- `murals:write` - Create, update, and delete murals
- `templates:read` - Read template information
- `templates:write` - Create and delete templates
- `identity:read` - Read user profile information

## Rate Limiting

The Mural API implements rate limiting. Refer to the official documentation for current limits.

## Pagination

Many list endpoints support pagination using query parameters like `limit` and `offset`.

## Notes

This documentation is based on the official Mural API documentation as of the research date. Some endpoints may be deprecated or new ones may have been added. Always refer to the official documentation for the most up-to-date information.

The API appears to have two different endpoint naming conventions:

1. RESTful paths (e.g., `/murals/{muralId}`) - likely newer/preferred
2. Action-based paths (e.g., `/getmuralbyid`) - possibly legacy

When implementing, prefer the RESTful endpoints where available.

## Contents API Implementation Notes

The Contents API uses a consistent RESTful architecture for programmatic mural content manipulation:

1. **RESTful Design**: All endpoints follow RESTful conventions with resource-based URLs (e.g., `/murals/{muralId}/widgets`, `/murals/{muralId}/chat`). This provides predictable and intuitive API patterns.

2. **Hierarchical Structure**: Content resources are nested under their parent mural using the pattern `/murals/{muralId}/{resource}` for clear resource relationships.

3. **Batch Operations**: Widget creation endpoints support batch operations (especially sticky notes with up to 1000 per request) for efficient bulk content creation.

4. **Coordinate System**: Widget positioning uses an x,y coordinate system on the mural canvas, with (0,0) typically at the top-left.

5. **Interactive Features**: Advanced collaboration features like voting sessions, timers, and real-time chat are supported through dedicated resource endpoints.

6. **Content Management**: Full CRUD operations are supported for most widget types, enabling comprehensive mural content lifecycle management.
